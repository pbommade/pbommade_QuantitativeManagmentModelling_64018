# Question 1 : Formulate and solve the transportation Problem using R 
Prob= matrix(c(22,14,30,600,100,
               16,20,24,625,120,
               80,60,70,"-","-"),ncol=5,byrow=TRUE)
colnames(Prob)=c("Warehouse 1","Warehouse 2","Warehouse 3","Production cost","Production   capacity")
rownames(Prob)=c("Plant A","Plant B","Demand")
Prob

# Min TC = 22x11 + 14x12 + 30x13 + 16x21 + 20x22 + 24x23

# Subject to
# supply Constraints
    # x11 + x12 + x13 <= 100
    # x21 + x22 + x23 <= 120
# Demand Constraints
    # x11 + x21 >= 80
    # x12 + x22 >= 60
    # x13 + x23 >= 70

library(lpSolve)
costs = matrix(c(622,614,630,0,
                 641,645,649,0), ncol=4, byrow= TRUE)
#Since Production capacity and Demand values are unbalanced, we are creating a dummy column of the value 10
#column names and row names are mentioned as:
colnames(costs) = c("Warehouse 1","Warehouse 2","Warehouse 3","dummy")
rownames(costs) = c("Plant A","Plant 2")
costs

#Setting up row signs and production capacity values
row.signs= rep("<=",2)
row.rhs= c(100,120)

#setting up column signs and demand values
col.signs=rep(">=",4)
col.rhs=c(80,60,70,10)

#Running lptrans command to find the minimum cost
lptrans <- lp.transport(costs, "min", row.signs, row.rhs, col.signs, col.rhs)

#Variables for the given Prob
lptrans$solution

# Objective function is
lptrans$objval

# Therefore
  # x12 = 60
  # x13 = 40
  # x21 = 80
  # x23 = 30
  # and objective function is 132790
